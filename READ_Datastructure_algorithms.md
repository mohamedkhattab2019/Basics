# Notation And code efficiency(Complexty)
* efficienncy mean how will you're using your computer resources to get a particular job done.
* you can devide it into a two main categ. `space` and `Time`.
* **Time** mean how long does you're code take to run. 
* **space** mean how much storage space do you need ?
* ***Efficiency*** mean to get the most done with minimum resources 
* **Notation**
* example : lets say we need to add 200 to input which method below will be faster:
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      for 2 iteration :
        add 100 to input  
    </td>
    <td>
      for 100 iteration :
        add 2 to input
